										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tupakulagudem Barrage :</strong><br />
<strong>Location:</strong><br />
The Tupakulagudem Barrage is situated 23 kilometres downstream of the Ichampally Project site on the River Godavari, the Tupakulagudem Barrage is situated 23 kilometres downstream of the Ichampally Project site. The Kanthanapally Barrage was relocated 17 kilometres upstream to Tupakulagudem (Village), Eturunagaram (Mandal), in Warangal District, Telangana State, India, as part of re-engineering, and was given the new name Tupakulagudem Barrage. Villages in the current barrage location are not submerged. The Kanthanapally Barrage was relocated 17 kilometres upstream to Tupakulagudem (Village), Eturunagaram (Mandal), in Warangal District, Telangana State, India, as part of re-engineering, and was given the new name Tupakulagudem Barrage. Villages in the current barrage location are not submerged.<br />
<strong>Barrage Objective :</strong><br />
The plan calls for lifting and diverting water from the already-existing Devadula Lift Irrigation Scheme, which serves about 6.5 lakh acres in the Warangal and Nalgonda districts, in order to use Godavari water. The barrage, which was constructed across the river, essentially serves as a structure that directs the river&#8217;s required quantity of flows for agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, home water supply, and industrial water supply.<br />
<strong>Engineering</strong><br />
Designed Flood Discharge: 85,000 Cumecs<br />
Operational Pond Level: + 83.00 Mts<br />
Length of Barrage: 1132 Mts (Deep Gorge- 280 Mts &#038; Rock section – 852 Mts)<br />
Height of Barrage: 30 Mts<br />
Length Of Apron: 105 Mts<br />
Length of Pier in Rock Section: 55 Mts<br />
Length of Pier in Deep George Section: 105 Mts<br />
Estimated Concrete quantity to be laid with M25 and M60 grade: About 13.5 lakh cum<br />
Number of vents: 59 nos. (48 nos Spill Way &#038; 11 nos Under Sluice)<br />
Gate Size: 15 Mts X 14 Mts for Spill way &#038; 15 Mts X 15 Mts for Under Sluice<br />
Sill Level: +71.00 Mts for Spill Way &#038; + 70.00 Mts for Under Sluice<br />
Top Level of Two lane Road Bridge connecting Chathisgarh and Telangana States: +92.00 Mts.<br />
Design Discharge of head Regulator for Supply water for power generation 3300 Cumecs</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Basanthpur Barrage Constructed a barrage across Mahanadi River, Near Basanthpur Village</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>
<p>Basantpur Barrage constructed a barrage across Mahanadi River near Basantpur village of Tehsil Champa in Jangir-Champa dist. C.G. The site is located about 40 Km away from Champa town by road.</p>
<p><strong>Barrage Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The barrage is projected to have a storage capacity of approximately 54 M. cum (1.90 TMC), which will be used to provide water to five neighboring power stations. In addition, it will help conserve water and recharge the groundwater table, which will help meet the water supply needs of the adjacent villages that experience severe water shortages every summer.<br />

<p>Vented Dam constructed across Nethravathi River near Thumbe. The site is located about 20 Km away from Mangalore.</p>
<h1>Objective of Vented Dam:</h1>
<p>An old anicut has storage facilities for the city of Mangalore&#8217;s drinking water demands, and these can be temporarily filled with wooden boards. It is proposed to build a permanent concrete dam with vertical spillway gates to store water to a higher elevation of +7 M, i.e., to 2.0 TMC of water for daily water supply to Mangalore city and other industrial purposes, among other things. This is due to the increased demand for water supply to meet the needs of the developed Mangalore city. This dam was constructed as a result.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pula Subbaiah Veligonda Project</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Machine</strong> Type Double Shield TBM</u><br />
<strong><u>Diameter</strong> 10.0 m (Cross section 78.56 sqm)</u><br />
<strong><u>Tunnel Type:</strong> Water Transfer</u><br />
<strong><u>Tunnel Length:</strong> 18.8 km</u><br />
<strong><u>Owner:</strong> Government of Andhra Pradesh</u><br />
<strong><u>Location:</strong> Prakasam District, Andhra Pradesh, India</u><br />
<strong><u>Pro</u></strong><strong><u>ject Overview</u></strong></p>
<p>One of India&#8217;s greatest water transfer systems is being carried out using tunnel boring machines beneath NagarjunaSagar National Park, the country&#8217;s largest tiger sanctuary. In order to complete Tunnel No. 2 of the Pula SubbaiahVeligonda project, RPPL is deploying a Robbins Double Shield TBM.</p>
<p>The potential inlet site for the Pula SubbaiahVeligonda Project is located on the Krishna River, on the right bank of the Srisailam Canal. After it is finished, the system will be able to yearly remove 1.2 billion cubic meters (317.0 billion gallons) of flood water from the Srisailam reservoir&#8217;s shore. Water will be delivered to more than 1,600 square kilometers (395,368 acres) of farmland in the three districts of Prakasam, Nellore, and Kadapa via two parallel tunnels that are 19.2 km (11.9 mi) long. The bored tunnels will carry water at speeds of up to 243 cubic meters per second (64,193 gallons per second) to a feeder canal.</p>
<p>The geology of the Cuddapah Basin, where the Veligonda Tunnel No. 2 is situated in sedimentary rock, is complicated by numerous faults and folds. Shale with interbedded limestone and phyllite makes about 40% of the rock, which has a UCS of 90 to 225 MPa (13,000 to 33,000 psi) and is composed primarily of quartzite. There are some ground waters and two main faults.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment Design</strong></p>
<p>To handle the difficult ground conditions, the Double Shield machine has 67 back-loading cutters with a 20-inch diameter. Low penetration rates in the hard rock can be made up for by running the machine at a higher-than-normal RPM thanks to specially developed drive motors. The cutter head can move vertically while compressing the ground, enabling over-boring. Additionally, the machine features a probe drill that enables geology to be checked 30 metres (98 feet) in advance of the TBM. The drill can rotate 360 degrees and also be used as a grout consolidation drill. To pump any water away from the tunnel face, large 40 kW (54 hp) dewatering pumps are installed on the backup system. The TBM constructs 300 mm (12 inch) thick concrete segments in a 6+1 configuration as it drills, resulting in a 9.2 m final tunnel diameter (30 ft).<br />
One of the largest conveyor systems ever deployed in India is needed for muck transport. Robbins will eventually offer a continuous steel cable belt that will be 18.8 km long, requiring four main drives and three booster drives.</p>
