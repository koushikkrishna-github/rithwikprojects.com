										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tupakulagudem Barrage :</strong><br />
<strong>Location:</strong><br />
The Tupakulagudem Barrage is situated 23 kilometres downstream of the Ichampally Project site on the River Godavari, the Tupakulagudem Barrage is situated 23 kilometres downstream of the Ichampally Project site. The Kanthanapally Barrage was relocated 17 kilometres upstream to Tupakulagudem (Village), Eturunagaram (Mandal), in Warangal District, Telangana State, India, as part of re-engineering, and was given the new name Tupakulagudem Barrage. Villages in the current barrage location are not submerged. The Kanthanapally Barrage was relocated 17 kilometres upstream to Tupakulagudem (Village), Eturunagaram (Mandal), in Warangal District, Telangana State, India, as part of re-engineering, and was given the new name Tupakulagudem Barrage. Villages in the current barrage location are not submerged.<br />
<strong>Barrage Objective :</strong><br />
The plan calls for lifting and diverting water from the already-existing Devadula Lift Irrigation Scheme, which serves about 6.5 lakh acres in the Warangal and Nalgonda districts, in order to use Godavari water. The barrage, which was constructed across the river, essentially serves as a structure that directs the river&#8217;s required quantity of flows for agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, home water supply, and industrial water supply.<br />
<strong>Engineering</strong><br />
Designed Flood Discharge: 85,000 Cumecs<br />
Operational Pond Level: + 83.00 Mts<br />
Length of Barrage: 1132 Mts (Deep Gorge- 280 Mts &#038; Rock section – 852 Mts)<br />
Height of Barrage: 30 Mts<br />
Length Of Apron: 105 Mts<br />
Length of Pier in Rock Section: 55 Mts<br />
Length of Pier in Deep George Section: 105 Mts<br />
Estimated Concrete quantity to be laid with M25 and M60 grade: About 13.5 lakh cum<br />
Number of vents: 59 nos. (48 nos Spill Way &#038; 11 nos Under Sluice)<br />
Gate Size: 15 Mts X 14 Mts for Spill way &#038; 15 Mts X 15 Mts for Under Sluice<br />
Sill Level: +71.00 Mts for Spill Way &#038; + 70.00 Mts for Under Sluice<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Basanthpur Barrage Constructed a barrage across Mahanadi River, Near Basanthpur Village</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>
<p>Basantpur Barrage constructed a barrage across Mahanadi River near Basantpur village of Tehsil Champa in Jangir-Champa dist. C.G. The site is located about 40 Km away from Champa town by road.</p>
<p><strong>Barrage Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The barrage is projected to have a storage capacity of approximately 54 M. cum (1.90 TMC), which will be used to provide water to five neighboring power stations. In addition, it will help conserve water and recharge the groundwater table, which will help meet the water supply needs of the adjacent villages that experience severe water shortages every summer.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tehri Power Complex, which consists of the Tehri Dam &amp; HPP (1000 MW), Tehri PSP (1000 MW), and Koteshwar HEP (4X100 = 400 MW), was designed to maximize the river Bhagirathi&#8217;s hydroelectric potential. It is located 22 kilometers downstream of Tehri. It will make it easier for Tehri Power Complex to function as a significant peaking station in the Northern Grid since Koteshwar Dam&#8217;s reservoir, which has a live storage capacity of 35.0 MCM, would serve as the lower (balancing) reservoir for Tehri PSP. This project also controls how much water is released for agriculture from the Tehri reservoir.</p>
<p>The original work was awarded in November 2002 for 394 Cr and was successfully completed in 2013 for a total work value of approximately 1000 Cr.</p>
<p>This project involves lining a 593 m long, 8.0 m wide horseshoe-shaped diversion tunnel and a 500 m long, 8.0 m wide D-shaped access tunnel to reach the open powerhouse. The whole project entails the excavation of it is a concrete gravity dam with a maximum height of approximately 100 meters above the deepest foundation. Four spillways with four 18m x 16m radial gates make up this dam&#8217;s four spillways. On the right bank, a power intake was built with four 6.2-meter-diameter penstocks. On the right bank, a surface powerhouse was built at the dam&#8217;s toe. Additionally, this project entails erecting civil works in the outside switch yard, such as tower basements and switch yard control rooms. The total Excavation qty executed in this project is 82 Lakh cum, and total Concrete qty executed in this project is 10.68 Lakh Cum.</p>
<p>All four units (Unit-I, Unit-II, Unit-III &amp; Unit-IV) were synchronized with the Northern Grid in March’ 11, March’11, Jan’12 &amp; Mar’12 respectively.</p>
